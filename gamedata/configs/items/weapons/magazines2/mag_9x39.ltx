;do not edit this file to add new magazines, create a new file in this folder with a name starting with mag_. 
;What ammo a mag takes as well as what guns it fits are determined by it's base_type. see configs/magazines2/_importer.ltx for explanation of base_type

;Naming convention:
;None of this is technical and can be ignored although it is strongly recomended to atlest start the section with mag_
;Magazines that are not shared by multiple guns tend to be named after the gun they fit. 
;If the magazine fits only one gun and that gun does not have an alternitive ammo type caliber is omited from the mag section.
;Mag sections ending in _default are used as the a weapons defualt magazine
;Mag sections ending in _alt exist only for a gun upgraded to a new caliber and are omited from trade profiles and drop/loot tables.
;_alt magazines are obtainable by modifying another magazine with a multi tool
;_alt magazines tend to be worth less than their pristine counter parts. 

;retool_group is a keyword assosiation for magazines that can be changed into one another. Retool groups can have an arbitrary number of members.
